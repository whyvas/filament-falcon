# Filament Falcon audio
## Audio troubleshooting (garbled / choppy sound)

1. Run the game without the intercom: `./run.sh --no-ics`. Clean sound here means the intercom helper is the problem.
2. Check the server rate (should be 48000): `pactl info | grep -i 'sample spec'`
3. Read the intercom log: `tail -n 40 ~/.local/share/filament-falcon/ics.log`. Look for underruns/xruns.
4. Look for leftover sinks from a crash: `pactl list short modules | grep -i falcon`. To clear them: `pactl list short modules | awk '/falcon/{print $1}' | xargs -r -n1 pactl unload-module`
5. Measure the delay through a headset: `python3 tools/falcon_ics.py --latency-test pilot`

The intercom runs at a fixed 48 kHz with 10 ms blocks and about 30 ms of buffer (around 50-60 ms end to end). PulseAudio/PipeWire resample any headset that runs at 44.1 kHz. When the helper stops, the game moves its audio back to the default output.

## Mic silent / stations swapping devices

- **Commander → ICS:** under each station there's a **MIC IN** and an **AUDIO OUT** picker (Headset / None / System default / a specific device) with a live mic meter. A device already picked by another station is skipped, never taken from it. Picks are saved and apply immediately.
- Headsets are matched by USB port, so two identical headsets (the Logitech pair) stay on their seats. Keep each one in the same USB port.
- The log shows what each station opened and its levels every 10 s: `grep -E "INPUT|OUTPUT|levels|MUTED|capture" ~/.local/share/filament-falcon/ics.log | tail -n 30`
- A source that's muted or suspended in the system mixer is woken up and unmuted automatically (logged).
- Still silent? Paste `pactl list short sources` (while the game is running) and the grep above.

## A station hears nothing (AUDIO OUT)

- Each ICS station card has an **OUT meter** + state under the mic meter: `▶ OUT playing` (green) means the helper is writing to that device right now; the bar is the level it sends (game audio, intercom, beeps). `OUT ERROR` (red) = the stream to that device keeps failing (the log has the reason).
- **IDENTIFY** on a station card plays a chime + "Pilot station" (espeak-ng) through **that station's AUDIO OUT stream**, whatever the mic is. The SETUP page's headset IDENTIFY still beeps the headset itself.
- AUDIO OUT picks are saved as node name **plus USB port** (`…analog-stereo@port=3.3.4`). Identical headsets (the two Logitechs) get node names that only differ by a `.2` counter, and that counter follows plug/boot order, so a name-only pick could point at the other headset after a reboot. Picks from before this change are plain names: **re-pick AUDIO OUT once per station** to store the port.
- When a card exposes several outputs (analog + digital/iec958), the analog one is used for "Headset". Mono-only devices get a mono stream, everything else a stereo stream with the voice in both ears.
- A muted or suspended sink is woken up and unmuted (logged); a sink at < 5 % volume is logged as a warning.
- Log: `grep -E "route|OUTPUT|outputs|IDENTIFY|sink was" ~/.local/share/filament-falcon/ics.log | tail -n 40`. Every 10 s `outputs:` shows per station the peak dB sent, the stream state and the sink name.
